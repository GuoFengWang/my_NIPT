This is a minor update: In this version I have:

Added contact information to vignette
Added examples to the function information fields (\dontrun{}, since large datasets would be necessary to test)

This is a resubmission (2). In this version I have:

Changed title from "Fast and Accurate Trisomy Prediction in NIPT"
